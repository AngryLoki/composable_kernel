# CK Python API
This API uses Python to generate instances of operations present in CK, compiles them into a shared library, and an executable to run the instances.
There are 2 directories: shared and normal. The normal directory contains one instance that will compile into an excutable to be run, while the shared directory 
generates multiple instances and compiles them into a shared library.
